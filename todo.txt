        1. GUI initiated as Empty React Project
    TODO:
        1. Understand where I am staying. (!!!very important!!!)
        2. George Graph comparison should be started (!important!)
        3. Understand how to link GUI and backend somehow.

        1.Added into  a Git repo

    Done:
        1. In order to not overcomplicate the logic, results are re-collected from the existing CSV
           files and processed. For instance, FRE is calculated in this way. For that some concept
           of Reducer was introduced to generalize the such task if they will be needed
           
    TODO:
        1. Items from the previous list.
        2. Some refactoring:
             - Make save and load CSV as something general. The same code are spread over the whole
               code base.
             - Remove repeated code reducers
        3. Make a "setup.bat" to start coding from zero.
        4. Put the sources in Git repo.
        
    Next:
        1. Implementing GUI in some form. Meanwhile the variants to start are JavaFX and React. Most
           of chances GUI will be in WEB form...

2018-07-10:
    1. First need to collect results and only then report them. Some of properties depent on total
       result. For instance, FRE should be normalized within total run.
    2. Add non implemented Elena's metrics 
    3. Small refatoring to move from "starter" package to relevant packages
    4. Implement George Graph comparisons
    5. Start writting GUI (WEB?)
    6. Add Filtering Tokens Processor into container within appropriate flags in JSON config.
