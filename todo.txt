    Done:
        1. Some progress done with running simultaneously CoreNLP. CoreNPL cannot calculate simultaneously Annotation on
           the same pipeline. However, one pipeline requires about 800MB. Therefore CoreNLPTextProcessor changed such
           that StanfordCoreNLP (pipeline) is per working thread [i.e. on the ThreadLocal]. Since one pipeline is very
           heavy, there are at most 3 such pipelines [as well 3 threads] which now calculate Annotation simultaneously.
           It should be mentioned that memory required for the pipeline is caught from VisualVM [should be mentioned
           in the document]. Also is has no resource to read what exact element that allows parallelism in CoreNLP.
           Empirically it is proved that it is  StanfordCoreNLP. Despite of the fact that Annotating in parallel time
           reduced, serializing to disk failed on ConcurrentModificationException deep in the CoreNLP. Therefore it was
           decided that all Annotations firstly collected and then serially dumped by one thread. Also all caching for
           CoreNLP based metrics now are calculated before the metric calculation.

    Done:
        1. AutoSummENG partially implemented with Text<> and Caching in AutoSummENGTextProcessorTest
        2. Big redesign of project structure (Look 2018-10-23 Todo list, Item #2)
           a. Concrete Metrics now live in dedicated package
           b. Core package was cleaned up
           c. Starters and Containers are live in separate package
           d. Old ideas are deleted
        3. Merged to master
        4. TextProcessor cache is cleaner up
    TODO:
        1. Write reported for AutoSummENG.
        2. Add reporter to main starter and containers

    CONTINUE:
        Implementing AutoSummENG.
    Done:
        1. Pruned wrong direction of "George metrics" (still exists in the code)
        2. Added a test that shows how to compute AutoSummENG metrics
    TODO:
        1. Implement AutoSummENG with Text<> and Caching.

    CONTINUE:
        Implementing George metrics
    Done:
        1. TF-IDF will be calculated from topics.
        2.
    TODO:
        1. Refactor code copy-paste among Reporters which finds systems/peers/topics etc. Need to do it in more general
           maner.

    CONTINUE:
        Implementing George metrics
    Done:
        1. More or less structure of sep-config.json to support george metrics. The huge problem with his metrics that
           it just calculates the cross product between the documents. It is ok... but it is not good for the SEP
        2. Some tests are done to retrieve parsed document within Open Calais.

2018-10-23
    CONTINUE:
        Implementing George metrics
    Done:
        1. Started implementing George metrics within Text and TextProcessor.
    TODO:
        1. See the last one (2018-10-16)
        2. The project should be cleaned. It is salad in the names of packages:
            a. il.ac.sce.ir.metric.core.config should be cleared
            b. Need to clean very old ideas how the project should look like
            c. Need to move il.ac.sce.ir.metric.core.processor.token_filter being not under the core
        3. GUI with react will be too complicated?.. Looks like some simpler solution should be done.


2018-10-16
    Done:
        1. GUI initiated as Empty React Project
        2. Temp data is added to git repo
    TODO:
        1. Understand where I am staying. (!!!very important!!!)
        2. George Graph comparison should be started (!important!)
        3. Understand how to link GUI and backend somehow.
        4. Make project to be independent from the hard-link drive locations
        5. Add libraries and installation instructions to be added to mvn repository
        

2018-08-12:
    Done:
        1.Added into  a Git repo

2018-08-07:
    Done:
        1. In order to not overcomplicate the logic, results are re-collected from the existing CSV
           files and processed. For instance, FRE is calculated in this way. For that some concept
           of Reducer was introduced to generalize the such task if they will be needed
           
    TODO:
        1. Items from the previous list.
        2. Some refactoring:
             - Make save and load CSV as something general. The same code are spread over the whole
               code base.
             - Remove repeated code reducers
        3. Make a "setup.bat" to start coding from zero.
        4. Put the sources in Git repo.
        
    Next:
        1. Implementing GUI in some form. Meanwhile the variants to start are JavaFX and React. Most
           of chances GUI will be in WEB form...

2018-07-10:
    1. First need to collect results and only then report them. Some of properties depent on total
       result. For instance, FRE should be normalized within total run.
    2. Add non implemented Elena's metrics 
    3. Small refatoring to move from "starter" package to relevant packages
    4. Implement George Graph comparisons
    5. Start writting GUI (WEB?)
    6. Add Filtering Tokens Processor into container within appropriate flags in JSON config.
